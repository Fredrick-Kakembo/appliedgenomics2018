Assignment Date: Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018 <br>
Due Date: Thursday, Feb. 8, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will profile the overall structure of the genomes of several important species: 
yeast ([Saccharomyces cerevisiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)), 
fruit fly ([Drosophila melanogaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster)), 
thale cress ([Arabidopsis thaliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana)),
and human ([Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens))

As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2017/600649/home)

Some of the tools you will need to use this semester only run in a linux environment. If you do not have access to a linux machine, download and install a virtual machine following the directions here: https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2018/blob/master/assignments/virtualbox.md


Download the genome sequences:

- [Yeast Genome (sacCer3)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/yeast.fa.gz)
- [Fruit Fly Genome (dm6)](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/dm6/bigZips/dm6.fa.gz)
- [Arabidopsis Genome (TAIR10)](http://bit.ly/2GsXBsb) Note: Only download TAIR10_chr1.fas - TAIR10_chr5.fas
- [Human Genome (hg38)](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz) Note: Only download chr1.fa.gz - chr22.fa.gz, chrX.fa.gz, chrY.fa.gz




### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and 
all relevant figures (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and give the exact commands you used for 
solving the question. Submit your solutions by emailing the PDF as an attachment to "jhuappliedgenomics at gmail dot com" 
by 11:59pm on Feb 8. Name your PDF as "Lastname.Firstname.Asn1.pdf" (replace LastName.Firstname with your own name :-). 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
