## Assignment 1: Chromosome Structures
Assignment Date: Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018 <br>
Due Date: Thursday, Feb. 8, 2017 @ 11:59pm <br>

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will profile the overall structure of the genomes of several important species: 
- Arabidopsis ([Arabidopsis thaliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana))
- Corn ([Zea mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize))
- E. coli ([Escherichia coli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)
- Fruit fly ([Drosophila melanogaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster))
- Human ([Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens))
- Rice ([Oryza sativa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice))
- Worm ([Caenorhabditis elegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans))
- Yeast ([Saccharomyces cerevisiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae))


As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2017/600649/home)

Some of the tools you will need to use this semester only run in a linux environment. If you do not have access to a linux machine, download and install a virtual machine following the directions here: https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2018/blob/master/assignments/virtualbox.md


### Question 1: Chromosome structures

Download the chomosome size files for the following genomes (Note these have been preprocessed to only include main chromosomes):

- [Arabidopsis (TAIR10)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/TAIR10.chrom.sizes)
- [Corn (B73v4)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/zm4.chrom.sizes))
- [E. coli K12](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/ecoli.chrom.sizes)
- [Fruit Fly (dm6)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/dm6.chrom.sizes)
- [Human (hg38)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/hg38.chrom.sizes) 
- [Rice (IRGSP-1.0)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/rice.chrom.sizes) )
- [Worm (ce10)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/ce10.chrom.sizes)) 
- [Yeast (sacCer3)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/yeast.chrom.sizes)

Using these files, make a spreadsheet/table with the following information per species:

1. Total genome size
2. Number of chromosomes
3. Largest chromosome size and name
4. Smallest chromosome size and name


### Question 2: 



### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and 
all relevant figures (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and give the exact commands you used for 
solving the question. Submit your solutions by emailing the PDF as an attachment to "jhuappliedgenomics at gmail dot com" 
by 11:59pm on Feb 8. Name your PDF as "Lastname.Firstname.Asn1.pdf" (replace LastName.Firstname with your own name :-). 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
