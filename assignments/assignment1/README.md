As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2017/600649/home)

Some of the tools you will need to use this semester only run in a linux environment. If you do not have access to a linux machine, download and install a virtual machine following the directions here: https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2018/blob/master/assignments/virtualbox.md


### Question 1: Chromosome structures

Download the chomosome size files for the following genomes (Note these have been preprocessed to only include main chromosomes):

- [E coli K12](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/ecoli.chrom.sizes)
- [Yeast (sacCer3)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/yeast.chrom.sizes)
- [Fruit Fly (dm6)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/dm6.chrom.sizes)
- [Arabidopsis (TAIR10)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/TAIR10.chrom.sizes)
- [Human (hg38)](http://schatz-lab.org/appliedgenomics2018/assignments/assignment1/TAIR10.chrom.sizes) 




### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and 
all relevant figures (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and give the exact commands you used for 
solving the question. Submit your solutions by emailing the PDF as an attachment to "jhuappliedgenomics at gmail dot com" 
by 11:59pm on Feb 8. Name your PDF as "Lastname.Firstname.Asn1.pdf" (replace LastName.Firstname with your own name :-). 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
